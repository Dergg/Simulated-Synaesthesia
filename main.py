# IMC Coursework

# Has to involve at least one of the following:
# 1. Fourier / Inverse Fourier transform
# 2. Mathematical representations of scales, temparement and/or tuning
# 3. Computational models of beat, tempo and/or meter
# 4. Geometric models of harmony and/or voice-leading (e.g. Tonnetz)
# 5. Sequential models of music data (harmony, melody and/or rhythm)
# 6. Hierarchical models of music data
# 7. Neural models of music data

# Current ideas:
# - "This song sounds like [artist]": deep learning for artist recognition in music
# - Stem generator: give a music "part" (e.g. "bass", "drums", "lead") and a genre (e.g. "garage", "drum n bass", "rap"),
#   then generate a random stem for that part given the two parameters. All based on "vibes" and previous experience.
